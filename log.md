Today's Progress: 
Completed a Two Sum problem on 
Leetcode using a brute force approach.

Thoughts: 

Time complexity: O(n^2) 
I am using the brute force approach to find a fast solution to the problem resulting in a quadratic time complexity. In the future, I want to apply a faster optimal approach to this problem.
