100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 1: March 3, 2022 
Today's Progress: 
Completed a Two Sum problem on 
Leetcode using a brute force approach.

Thoughts: 

Time complexity: O(n^2) 
I am using the brute force approach to find a fast solution to the problem resulting in a quadratic time complexity. In the future, I want to apply a faster optimal approach to this problem.

Day 3: March 5, 2022 
Today's Progress: 
Completed a Two Sum problem on 
Leetcode using a optimal solution approach.


Thoughts: I chose to use a hash map to optimal solution to reduce the cost of time and optimize space. The benefit of using a hash map 0(1) lookup time. Instead of having to loop through each index twice, we use a hashmap to store key-value pairs. With this, we can take the difference of the target and check if the difference is present in the hash object. If we have a match , we are done, else we add the number and it's index in the map for future use.

Time complexity: 0(n)

Day 4: April 3, 2022 
Today's Progress: 
Completed Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array problem on 
Leetcode using a optimal solution approach.


Thoughts: Utilized two pointer method to remove duplicated in nums array. 

Time complexity: 0(n)
